            question: `What changes are being proposed for ${location}'s sign regulations?`,
            answer: `We are advocating for common sense sign rule updates, restricted to specific areas of I-35 and SH-45 only, that serve all businesses, including local ones and not just large out-of-town companies. These updates aim to ensure that new EMC signs are constructed attractively, resonate with the cityâ€™s branding, and avoid unnecessary clutter. Best of all, these changes come at no extra cost to Round Rock taxpayers.`
        },
        {
            question: `Why are these sign rule updates essential for ${location}?`,
            answer: `Round Rock is a modern city, and it deserves sign regulations that reflect its evolving nature. Updated rules will promote a cohesive city branding, benefit businesses of all sizes, and prevent the cityscape from being overwhelmed by signs.`
        },
        {
            question: `Are these changes going to be costly for ${location} taxpayers?`,
            answer: `No, the proposed sign rule updates are designed to be implemented at zero additional expense to the taxpayers of Round Rock.`

        {
            question: `How do the new rules for signs benefit the ${location} local economy?`,
            answer: `The Perryman Group report highlights the substantial economic benefits of typical digital billboards in Round Rock. For instance, during the construction phase, a billboard can contribute to $700,000 in gross product and support 7 job-years. Once fully operational, it can lead to an impressive $19.1 million in gross product each year and create 251 jobs. This increase in economic activity and job creation will support more sales tax revenue, business opportunities, and expansions.`
